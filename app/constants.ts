  {
    question: "How much will it cost to install a solar system in my house?",
    answer:
      "The cost depends on your power needs. We have a calculator that automatically recommends the right solar package for you based on your power needs. Please use our calculator and share result with us",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it power my fridge, freezer, and AC?",
    answer:
      "Yes, solar systems can power heavy appliances like fridges and air conditioners â€” but you have to select a system big enough to handle your load. Our solar calculator will recommend the perfect system for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does installation take?",
    answer:
      "Most installations are completed in a day, but larger systems may take 2â€“3 days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pay in installments?",
    answer:
      "Yes, installment payments are available, especially for businesses. For individuals, we also offer flexible options â€” just ask.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my solar system work during the rainy season?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it will. The system stores energy in batteries during sunny hours. However, we size your batteries to handle days with less sunlight.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use both NEPA and solar together?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Our systems allow you to switch between solar, generator, and NEPA seamlessly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my battery gets bad?",
    answer:
      "We offer warranty and after-sales support. If itâ€™s within warranty, we replace it. If not, weâ€™ll advise on affordable replacements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to service my solar system regularly?",
    answer:
      "Minimal maintenance is required. We recommend checking the batteries and cleaning the panels once in a while â€” we also offer maintenance plans.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my solar system later?",
    answer:
      "Yes, our systems are designed to be scalable. You can always add more panels or batteries as your needs grow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer warranty on your products?",
    answer:
      "Yes, all our components come with manufacturer warranty and our own installation guarantee.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the batteries last?",
    answer:
      "Most quality batteries last between 3 to 10 years, depending on the type and how well they are maintained. The two common battery types are lead-acid batteries and Lithium batteries. Lead-acid batteries often last between 3-6 years, depending on usage, while Lithium batteries last between 8-15 years, depending on usage",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I still need my generator after installing solar?",
    answer:
      "That depends on your system size. A well-sized solar and battery system can completely replace your generator for everyday use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you install in any part of Nigeria?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we serve all states in Nigeria. We have mobile teams ready to deploy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you do site inspection before installation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We carry out physical or virtual assessments to properly size your system and avoid over/under-designing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of solar panels do you use?",
    answer:
      "We use high-quality monocrystalline panels that are efficient and durable, suited for Nigerian weather.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my roof is not strong enough for solar panels?",
    answer:
      "Weâ€™ll assess your roofâ€™s condition first. If itâ€™s not suitable, we offer ground-mount or wall-mount options.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use solar for my borehole or water pump?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we can design a solar system specifically to handle your borehole or water pump reliably.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between an inverter and a solar system?",
    answer:
      "An inverter converts battery/DC power to usable AC. A full solar system includes panels, batteries, and the inverter to generate and store power.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many solar panels do I need?",
    answer:
      "It depends on your energy consumption. Weâ€™ll calculate your load and design the number of panels accordingly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use prepaid meter with solar?",
    answer:
      "Yes, your solar system can work alongside a prepaid meter without issues. In fact, it reduces how much you spend on NEPA.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is solar power safe for my electronics?",
    answer:
      "Yes, itâ€™s even safer than NEPA or generator power because it delivers stable, clean energy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my solar system work at night?",
    answer:
      "Yes, your battery stores solar energy generated during the day, so you can use it at night.",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of battery is best?",
    answer:
      "We recommend lithium batteries for longevity and performance, though we also offer quality tubular and AGM options based on your budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I monitor my system remotely?",
    answer:
      "Yes, some of our systems support remote monitoring via mobile apps or online dashboards.",
  },
  {
    question: "Whatâ€™s the minimum system I can install?",
    answer:
      "You can start small â€” even a 1kVA system â€” and upgrade later. Weâ€™ll help you plan based on your needs and budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with load auditing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we help you calculate and prioritize your loads so you only power what you really need.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept bank transfers mainly",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if solar is right for me?",
    answer:
      "If you experience frequent power outages, spend heavily on fuel, or want to cut energy bills, solar is a great solution.",
  },
  {
    question: "Whatâ€™s the difference between off-grid and hybrid systems?",
    answer:
      "Off-grid systems rely only on solar and batteries. Hybrid systems combine solar with NEPA or generator as backup.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run my entire house on solar?",
    answer:
      "Yes, if the system is properly sized. Weâ€™ve helped many clients go 100% solar without any need for NEPA or generator.",
